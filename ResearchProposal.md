# Research Proposal
  
## Intro

For my research I want to focus on how neural networks and machine learning algorithms respond to well-labeled MIDI inputs.

Although I have not decided the exact project I want to complete, the subject of MIDI and algorithms is something that I am highly interested in. The only project outside of the Music genre is to focus on the trade volume and pricing of all items traded in the classic game Old School Runescape. I will go into that project idea further at the end of this proposal as it is a good option if I chose to focus on historical *and* live data.

## Data Science Category (Theoretical and conceptual)

The research will fall into the category of music generation (synthesis).

## Skills Required

* Knowledge of MIDI
* Knowledge of basic music structure and patterns
* Knowledge of neural networks
  * training, tweaking, etc.
* Much more

### Current Skills

* Knowledge of MIDI and advanced music structure

### Skills to-be-learned

The main concept that I need to learn is how MIDI can be implemented into a Neural Network, or other prediction algorithms.

## OSRS GE Tracking Project Idea

This is another project that I might also pursue reaching. The Grand Exchange (GE), is a way for million of players to trade billions of items daily. Every trade and quantity is stored by both the community and developers. I would research the possibility of predicting the price of each of the thousand of items in the game that can be traded. There are a few community managed APIs that can be used to collect both live (real-time) data as well as more than 5 years of historical data.
