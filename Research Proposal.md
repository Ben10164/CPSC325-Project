# Research Proposal

* The research proposal is a well-written, well-organized, and grammatically-correct narrative (e.g. not a bulleted list) describing:
* What are the general DS topic areas (e.g. conceptual/theoretical) your eventual project will fall within
* What are the general DS skills (e.g. programming languages, cloud platforms, frameworks, libraries, APIs, algorithms, etc.) you will need to undertake your eventual project
* Which of these topics/skills do you already know
* Which of these topics/skills will you need to learn
* How you will learn the necessary topics/skills (e.g. online course(s), tutorial series, book(s), etc.) and what appropriate “proof of completion” looks like (e.g. badge(s), certificate(s), demoing completion of a project from a book, etc.)
* Note how many hours will it take to complete, targeting at least (6 to 9 hours a week) * (4 weeks) = 24 - 36 hours
* Note that the project's research phase covers the first ~4 weeks of the semester. Towards the end of the research phase, you will write up your detailed project proposal. Until then, you do not need to commit to the exact scope/details of your project.
  
## Intro

For my research I want to focus on how neural networks and machine learning algorithms respond to well-labeled MIDI inputs.

Although I have not decided the exact project I want to complete, the subject of MIDI and algorithms is something that I am highly interested in. The only project outside of the Music genre is to focus on the trade volume and pricing of all items traded in the classic game Old School Runescape. I will go into that project idea further at the end of this proposal as it is a good option if I chose to focus on historical *and* live data.
