# Research Proposal

* The research proposal is a well-written, well-organized, and grammatically-correct narrative (e.g. not a bulleted list) describing:
* What are the general DS topic areas (e.g. conceptual/theoretical) your eventual project will fall within 
* What are the general DS skills (e.g. programming languages, cloud platforms, frameworks, libraries, APIs, algorithms, etc.) you will need to undertake your eventual project
* Which of these topics/skills do you already know
* Which of these topics/skills will you need to learn
* How you will learn the necessary topics/skills (e.g. online course(s), tutorial series, book(s), etc.) and what appropriate “proof of completion” looks like (e.g. badge(s), certificate(s), demoing completion of a project from a book, etc.)
* Note how many hours will it take to complete, targeting at least (6 to 9 hours a week) * (4 weeks) = 24 - 36 hours
* Note that the project's research phase covers the first ~4 weeks of the semester. Towards the end of the research phase, you will write up your detailed project proposal. Until then, you do not need to commit to the exact scope/details of your project.
